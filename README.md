# July The Vote
Infographics and resources to educate and foster dialogue on civic engagement, sent out each day of July 2020.

## The Preface
The November election is only a few months away. Not only will the outcome determine the next presidency, but state elections will affect the redistricting of congressional districts for the next 10 years. If we want to do away with unfair and racist gerrymandering and bring justice to underrepresented communities, we must get out the vote in November.

## The Initiative
Throughout July, various social media infographics will be provided for you to share, along with articles and resources, aimed at educating people on civic engagement and registering new voters. Each graphic will include descriptive content along with a space for users to tag friends. There will be eight infographics sent in July, and additional resources will be sent out during the other 22 days.

## The Focus
The series will cover the main ideas of voter suppression, alternate ways to vote, elected government, gerrymandering, teen civic engagement, and will end the month with voter turnout. Various aspects of each main idea will be touched upon each day.

## The Organizer
This project is being organized by Cameron Samuels for the Teen Justice Fellowship of the Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism in Washington, DC. All graphics were created by Cameron using Canva.
