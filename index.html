      <strong>Latest Message (July 4) &mdash;</strong>
      Happy Fourth! Although most Americans take pride in our ability to self-govern, many overlook the centuries-long disenfranchisement of BIPOC that leaves them underrepresented in places such as voting and government. If you identify as white, reflect upon how your voice may be heard above others in these spaces and how you can change this on an individual level.
