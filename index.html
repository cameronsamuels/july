            Many blue collar workers are unable to vote on Election Day due to their work shifts, discouraging voter participation among people who may in turn become even more disadvantaged without their voice being heard. Although making Election Day a federal holiday produces many benefits, it also presents issues stemming from the root of the problem.

            Absentee ballots allow people to vote without being present at an in-person polling center. All states provide mail-in ballots upon request, but some require an excuse. There are many advantages to offering mail-in voting, but there are a couple considerations to account for as well. Learn about and check your state's rules regarding absentee ballots from NCSL at <a href="https://bit.ly/2BVcfei">bit.ly/2BVcfei</a>

            Online voter registration can save time during busy working schedules and encourage voter participation. Unfortunately, 11 states do not offer online registration despite it being more secure and cost efficient. In Arizona, each paper registration costs 83 cents while online registration is just 3 cents each.

            Happy Fourth! Although most Americans take pride in our ability to self-govern, many overlook the centuries-long disenfranchisement of BIPOC that leaves them underrepresented in places such as voting and government. If you identify as white, reflect upon how your voice may be heard above others in these spaces and how you can change this on an individual level.
