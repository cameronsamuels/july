      Youth turnout in Texas for voters aged 18-30 was up by more than 500% in the 2018 election compared to the last midterm election in 2014 according to the Houston Chronicle. Similar trends were present in other states as well. However, youth turnout has not been high in recent decades. Learn why from Tufts at <a href="https://bit.ly/3f64Ypw">bit.ly/3f64Ypw</a>

            Voting is mandatory in roughly 1 in 10 countries through a concept called compulsory voting that aims to increase participation in democracy. While it does increase voter turnout, it is often not enforced. Some say it legitimizes the outcome to represent everyone, but others point out that random or uninformed votes increase.

            Automatic voter registration has voter rolls continuously updated or added to when people interact with government agencies such as the DMV when issuing a driver's license. Because data becomes digital, this saves money, paper, and time, and it increases accuracy and accessibility. Learn more from the Brennan Center at <a href="https://bit.ly/2WV6DI4">bit.ly/2WV6DI4</a>

            Gerrymandering often consists of districts that span across multiple cities, or districts that encompass distinct changes in population density (rural and urban), racial composition, or income levels. Just think: can one person adequately represent the needs of everyone in the district? Check out the "Atlas of Redistricting" by FiveThirtyEight which allows you to see the racial composition of each district, understand the partisan politics behind current districts, and play around with hypothetical redistricting <a href="https://53eig.ht/2CMdixb">53eig.ht/2CMdixb</a>

            State legislatures are responsible for redistricting in 35 states, providing a large potential for incumbent politicians to benefit themselves over the people they represent. Independent commissions that draw the lines of political districts without influence from the greedy interests of legislators could be a solution. However, opposition to these commissions include the inability to hold them accountable as you cannot "vote them out" if they misbehave.

            The task of redistricting is up to or appointed by state legislatures following the completion of the census taken at the beginning of each decade (i.e. this year!). There are many different concepts and methods to consider when redrawing these districts, and we must understand them before diving deeper into the problems and solutions of gerrymandering.

            A concept called "gerrymandering" allows politicians to choose their voters, making it harder for voters to choose their politicians. The term "Gerry-mander" was coined by the Boston Gazette in a satirical cartoon when MA Governor Elbridge Gerry redistricted the state senate in 1812 to benefit the Democratic-Republican Party, in which a district resembled a mythical salamander. Modern-day gerrymandering to benefit a specific party occurs in so many places across the country, and it is a cruel form of voter suppression that devalues the voices of democracy.

            More than 15 million eligible voters did not vote in 2016 because they did not have transportation to the polls. Among these are the elderly, people of different abilities, and people without personal transportation.

            Many blue collar workers are unable to vote on Election Day due to their work shifts, discouraging voter participation among people who may in turn become even more disadvantaged without their voice being heard. Although making Election Day a federal holiday produces many benefits, it also presents issues stemming from the root of the problem.

            Happy Fourth! Although most Americans take pride in our ability to self-govern, many overlook the centuries-long disenfranchisement of BIPOC that leaves them underrepresented in places such as voting and government. If you identify as white, reflect upon how your voice may be heard above others in these spaces and how you can change this on an individual level.
