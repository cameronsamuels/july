      Did you know there are runoff elections possibly happening in your community? In Georgia, there are two US Senate runoff elections that will determine the partisan control of Congress. There is one week left to register to vote in Georgia, so text a friend and let them know!

            More than 90 million Americans have already cast ballots, setting records for early voter turnout across the country, especially among young voters. There are still 3 more days until the election is over, so go through your contact list and ensure your friends have made a plan to vote (no more mailing ballotsâ€“dropoff instead!)

            If you or your friends will be voting by mail, TODAY is the day to return your ballot to ensure it will be counted in time. Some states provide the option to dropoff your ballot in-person, so use that option if you can. Election Day is just one week away, but the election is not in one week: the election is happening now!

            60% of people voted on election day in 2018 (source: US Census Bureau). Many people are turned away on election days or have to wait in hours-long lines. Don't wait until Nov 3, the stakes are too high! Have you made a plan to vote early? Have your friends?

            We are 17 days away from Election Day, so make a plan to vote early! When voting in-person, your state may require you to have a photo ID from a specific list of documents. When voting by mail, there may also be strict identification requirements. Lookup your state's voter ID laws at <a href="https://bit.ly/357Q531">bit.ly/357Q531</a>

            Many states are already sending absentee ballots to voters, and in-person early voting takes place this month for many states. Lookup your state's early voting dates and mark your calendar with a plan to vote. Make sure you determine your transportation and verify that you have an acceptable voter ID. Use <a href="https://plantwovote.com">plantwovote.com</a> to ensure you are all set. Tell a friend about your voting plan and discuss theirs too!

            People are far more likely to vote if someone they know encourages them to, a concept known as relational organizing. Posting on social media can definitely spread the word, but having a conversation with a friend could actually get them out to vote.

            Voting by mail is an accessible and convenient way to vote, and it is also a no-risk method of voting during this pandemic. However, 92,000 mail ballots were tossed in 2016 due to mismatched signatures according to the Election Assistance Commission, raising concerns about disenfranchisement. Make sure your signature matches the one on record! You have also probably heard the chatter about the USPS and security of mail-in ballots, but did you know you may be able to drop-off your ballot in-person to ensure it gets counted? <a href="https://bit.ly/3iRVAsk">bit.ly/3iRVAsk</a>

            The COVID-19 pandemic has undeniably presented problems that could affect the election this year, and one of them is with election clerks. Pew Research found that the majority of poll workers in 2016 were above the age of 60, meaning there will likely be a shortage this year due to health concerns. If polling stations are understaffed, they will have long wait times or be forced to close. Becoming a Student Election Clerk is a great way for people under the age of 18 to help in the democratic process (and most of the time it's paid!).

            Voting is mandatory in roughly 1 in 10 countries through a concept called compulsory voting that aims to increase participation in democracy. While it does increase voter turnout, it is often not enforced. Some say it legitimizes the outcome to represent everyone, but others point out that random or uninformed votes increase.

            Gerrymandering often consists of districts that span across multiple cities, or districts that encompass distinct changes in population density (rural and urban), racial composition, or income levels. Just think: can one person adequately represent the needs of everyone in the district? Check out the "Atlas of Redistricting" by FiveThirtyEight which allows you to see the racial composition of each district, understand the partisan politics behind current districts, and play around with hypothetical redistricting <a href="https://53eig.ht/2CMdixb">53eig.ht/2CMdixb</a>

            State legislatures are responsible for redistricting in 35 states, providing a large potential for incumbent politicians to benefit themselves over the people they represent. Independent commissions that draw the lines of political districts without influence from the greedy interests of legislators could be a solution. However, opposition to these commissions include the inability to hold them accountable as you cannot "vote them out" if they misbehave.

            A concept called "gerrymandering" allows politicians to choose their voters, making it harder for voters to choose their politicians. The term "Gerry-mander" was coined by the Boston Gazette in a satirical cartoon when MA Governor Elbridge Gerry redistricted the state senate in 1812 to benefit the Democratic-Republican Party, in which a district resembled a mythical salamander. Modern-day gerrymandering to benefit a specific party occurs in so many places across the country, and it is a cruel form of voter suppression that devalues the voices of democracy.

            Happy Fourth! Although most Americans take pride in our ability to self-govern, many overlook the centuries-long disenfranchisement of BIPOC that leaves them underrepresented in places such as voting and government. If you identify as white, reflect upon how your voice may be heard above others in these spaces and how you can change this on an individual level.

            Thanks for joining July The Vote! Each day this month, an infographic or resource will be sent out. We'll learn about voter suppression, alternate ways to vote, elected government, gerrymandering, teen civic engagement, and ending the month with voter turnout. I encourage you each day to post the infographics on your social media story and take at least 10 minutes to read into and utilize the resources. Hope you enjoy! Text @julyvote to 81010 to receive the daily messages.
