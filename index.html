      A concept called "gerrymandering" allows politicians to choose their voters, making it harder for voters to choose their politicians. The term "Gerry-mander" was coined by the Boston Gazette in a satirical cartoon when MA Governor Elbridge Gerry redistricted the state senate in 1812 to benefit the Democratic-Republican Party, in which a district resembled a mythical salamander. Modern-day gerrymandering to benefit a specific party occurs in so many places across the country, and it is a cruel form of voter suppression that devalues the voices of democracy.

            More than 15 million eligible voters did not vote in 2016 because they did not have transportation to the polls. Among these are the elderly, people of different abilities, and people without personal transportation. As part of their LyftUp campaign, the rideshare service Lyft is offering free and discounted rides to the polls this year, expanding upon their 2018 campaign. Learn more from their blog post at <a href="https://lft.to/3eCa64k">lft.to/3eCa64k</a>, and search up the partnering organizations to support them.

            America is changing, and the electoral college does not have the same effect anymore. Out of the last three presidents (Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush), Obama was the only one to win the popular vote. Check out this Instagram post by So You Want To Talk About that discusses the Electoral College <a href="https://bit.ly/2ZpNvDY">bit.ly/2ZpNvDY</a> &mdash; Minor retraction/clarification: George W. Bush lost the popular vote in 2000 but won the popular vote in 2004.

            Many blue collar workers are unable to vote on Election Day due to their work shifts, discouraging voter participation among people who may in turn become even more disadvantaged without their voice being heard. Although making Election Day a federal holiday produces many benefits, it also presents issues stemming from the root of the problem.

            Absentee ballots allow people to vote without being present at an in-person polling center. All states provide mail-in ballots upon request, but some require an excuse. There are many advantages to offering mail-in voting, but there are a couple considerations to account for as well.

            Online voter registration can save time during busy working schedules and encourage voter participation. Unfortunately, 11 states do not offer online registration despite it being more secure and cost efficient. In Arizona, each paper registration costs 83 cents while online registration is just 3 cents each.

            Happy Fourth! Although most Americans take pride in our ability to self-govern, many overlook the centuries-long disenfranchisement of BIPOC that leaves them underrepresented in places such as voting and government. If you identify as white, reflect upon how your voice may be heard above others in these spaces and how you can change this on an individual level.
