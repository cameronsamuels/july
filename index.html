      Online voter registration can save time during busy working schedules and encourage voter participation. Unfortunately, 11 states do not offer online registration despite it being more secure and cost efficient. In Arizona, each paper registration costs 83 cents while online registration is just 3 cents each.

            Happy Fourth! Although most Americans take pride in our ability to self-govern, many overlook the centuries-long disenfranchisement of BIPOC that leaves them underrepresented in places such as voting and government. If you identify as white, reflect upon how your voice may be heard above others in these spaces and how you can change this on an individual level.
